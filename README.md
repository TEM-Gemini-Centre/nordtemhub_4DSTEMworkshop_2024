## NordTEMHub 4D STEM Workshop 2024

This year’s workshop will focus on how we can analyze (big) data from different 4D-STEM techniques and
understand and utilize data from new detectors. New possibilities given by better cameras, post processing
and data analysis have developed largely during the last years. In three days, invited experts and skilled educators
in this field will address the essentials and the latest developments through hands-on practical computer sessions. The
workshop will cover analysis of several types of 4D-STEM techniques, like scanning precession electron diffraction (SPED),
ptychography and differential phase contrast (DPC). We will teach how to use various open-source scientific Python packages
to analyze diffraction data, and in particular big datasets.
